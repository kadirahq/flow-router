# Changelog

### v2.10.0

### v2.9.0
* Add FlowRouter.url() See: [#374](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/374)

### v2.6.2
* Now .current() sends a cloned version of the internal current object. Which prevent outside mutations to params and queryParams

### v2.6.1

* Fix [#143](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/issues/314). 
  This says that when we are doing a trigger redirect,
  We won't get reactive changes like: `getRouteName()`

### v2.5.0
* Add a stop callback on the triggers. See: [#306](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/306).

### v2.4.0

* Add a name to the route groups. See: [#290](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/290)

### v2.3.0
* We've used `path` for both the current path and for the pathDef earlier. Now we differentiate it. See: [#272](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/issues/272) and [#273](https://github.com/kadirahq/flow-router/pull/273) for more information.

### v2.2.0
* Add the first addOn api: FlowRouter.onRouteRegister(cb)

### v1.13.0
* Remove browserified pagejs and qs dependency loading. With that we could reduce ~10kb of data size (without compression). We can look for a bower integration in the future. For now, here are the dependencies we have.
